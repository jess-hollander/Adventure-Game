# Adventure-Game
Custom made adventure game.

This game was made using Python using the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library. Source code can only be accessed by request due to plagarism standards. 

## Game Rules
- On start screen, player can move freely by using arrow keys (jump function using up arrow). Once the player enters the mountain door, you will enter the mountain to the start of the game.
- You may left-shoot using the *A* key, and right-shoot using the *D* key. There can only be 3 left-shoot, and 3 right-shoot bullets on the screen at a time to avoid bullet spamming and increase game difficulty.
- During the first 2 levels, there will be a new enemy that spawn from the tubes on either side of the screen and fall to the ground where the player is standing. The enemies will get more difficult as the game progresses. To kill an enemy, you must shoot them with a bullet and they will chnage to their dead image and fall off the screen. If an alive enemy collides with the player, the player will display a blast graphic and lose a life (lives remaining shown in bottom-right corner by number of player images).
- Once all enemies are dead, the game will progress to the next level.
- The third and final level is the boss battle. The boss enemy will spawn from the top tube rather than the side ones. To beat the boss, you must shoot it 3 times.
- If all lives are lost before beating the game, the game is over and a "Game Over" screen is displayed.
- If all enemies are dead and the player is still alive, the game is won and will display a "Game Won" screen.
- Have fun :))
